# Impact Statement — Early Warning Student Risk Classification

Early-warning risk prediction helps organizations that offer online learning experiences (e.g., online courses or certificate programs) take action earlier to help students while support can still change outcomes for a student. For example, identifying students who may fail.

This solution aims to use early course signals (assessment performance and engagement) to predict whether a learner, defined as a student, is likely to do well, withdraw or fail, in order to prioritize outreach and offer timely help when needed.

| Element | Impact Statement |
|---|---|
| **Direct Beneficiaries** | Learners benefit through earlier check-ins and supports, while student success advisors, instructors, and accessibility/learning support teams benefit by focusing attention on the highest-risk learners rather than waiting for late signals. |
| **Secondary Ripple** | Earlier interventions can improve completion rates, reduce repeat enrollments and related costs, and lower administrative workload, while helping close equity gaps by contacting learners proactively instead of after disengagement. |
| **Measurable KPI** | Within one term, contact **80% of learners predicted as High Risk within 7 days** of the prediction point and achieve a **10% reduction in withdrawals** among that flagged group compared with the prior term. |
| **Sustainability Link** | This supports **SDG 4 – Quality Education** by improving access to timely support and increasing successful completion rates through data-informed, student-centered interventions. |
